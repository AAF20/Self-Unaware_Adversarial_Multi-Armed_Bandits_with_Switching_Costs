This folder contains Matlab codes for the IEEE Transactions on Neural 
Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS) submission: 
titled "Self Unaware Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandits with Switching Costs". 
The reader can find the required codes related to the algorithms provided in the paper. All the main 
files and†corresponding†functions include necessary†in-line comments†to 
ease following the algorithms through the codes. 

Below please find the content provided in each folder:

- In the "Adversarial_Environment" folder, the reader can find how 
stochastically constrained adversarial environment is generated and 
tested. 

- In the "Algorithm_1_PORO-SC" folder, the reader can find the main 
m-file and all the required functions to run PORO-SC algorithm. The 
parameters can be set according to the setting provided in the paper. 

- In the "Algorithm_2_PBOA-SC" folder, the reader can find the main 
m-file and all the required functions to run PBOA-SC algorithm: The 
parameters can be set according to the setting provided in the paper.
